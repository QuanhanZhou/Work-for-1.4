## Prompt: 
“Revolutions in science have often been preceded by revolutions in measurement.” Sinan Aral (cited in Kitchen, 2014)   In “Big Data, New Epistemologies and Paradigm Shifts” by Rob Kitchen the author emphasizes the importance of measurement as a significant contributing factor for improved description and analysis of complex natural and/or social phenomenon. How is the advent of big data serving to advance this revolution in measurement and subsequently, how is this revolution in measurement serving to elevate data science as an interdisciplinary field of study? How is the data deluge advancing a better understanding of human movement, behavior and relationships? How does data science contribute towards our improved understanding of human development as a complex and adapting social and economic system?

## Essay:
In the article “The End of Theory: The Data Deluge Makes the Scientific Method Obsolete”, Chris Anderson proposed the idea that we have entered into a new era in history that serves a laboratory of human kind¬ ------ the Petabyte Age. The massive of amount of data is now stored in the cloud and tremendously revolutionized the conventional methods of measurement. Unlike the traditional ways of measurement that focus primarily in causations by establishing models, big data and new data analytics can advance the science without theories or any hypotheses at all. Instead, they apply statistical algorithms to find patterns of the world with the help of super computing clusters. 

A wonderful practical example raised by Chris is the shotgun gene sequencing by a man named J. Craig Venter. He discovered thousands of new species of bacteria and other life forms in an unexpected way: using high-speed sequencers and supercomputers. The crucial point here is that he managed to find a new life form without even recognizing how it looks like, never to mention how it lives. He simply has a unique sequence of data that is fresh new to our database, which indicates a new species. Through this process, our ordinary perception of “discovery” has been changed totally. There is no doubt that data science has been elevated into an important interdisciplinary field of study, since big data is now everywhere. Social science, biology, history, etc all their established epistemologies could be integrated with data science. 

Some concerns arise for the potential replacement of established epistemologies by this new innovative approach. However, in reality, the data-driven science provides a hybrid combination of abductive, inductive and deductive approaches as described in the article by Rob, to advance our comprehension towards human kind. When we learn more about the big data, we find that the epistemological strategies are embedded within and are used to guide discovery techniques. Furthermore, how these data are processed and analyzed would be guided by assumptions to which methods might imply practical insights.   

For scholars in social science that have long studied such complex systems as human development acknowledges the great potential for a computational and digital field of study with greater depth and breath. Enabled by the growing power of computation and new techniques, contexts could be analyzed in a more sensitive way, critiques of reductionism and universalism could be addressed, understandings of the world could be refined and advanced into a new level. These analysis of data and projects that render materials into digital forms can be integrated as a summation of contents and form the “digital humanities”, which in turns improve our understanding our human development.
