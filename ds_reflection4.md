Prompt: Provide three examples from Geoff West’s reading that illustrate how scale can be used to more fully understand human development as a complex and adapting social and economic system. Additionally, what did Geoff West have to say about the use of theory and big data? According to West, can a theory be relevant in the face of big data?  Provide an example.

The first example concerns our survival and that is the amount of food and energy consumed each day by animals (including us) to stay alive. We might speculate that the bigger we are, the more we eat. However, here is where scale comes into place and helps us understand ourselves and the biological world around us. Interestingly, an animal that is twice of the size of another, requires only about 75 percent more energy each day, rather than 100 percent. It turns out to be that metabolic rates scale with size: the larger animal is more efficient than smaller ones because less energy is required to spend each gram of tissue. 

Next comes the best part of Geoff West’s examples: the scaling of cities. He presented works from Dirk Helbing who investigated how various characteristics of cities scale with city size across Europe. He gathered graphs which depicted number of gas stations in a city relative to its size and found that the slope of the resulting straight line is approximately 0.85 for almost all European nations. This indicates a systematic economy of scale, which means that if a city’s population grows twice as bigger as before, it only needs 85% more gas stations to fulfil citizen’s needs. What’s more, other infrastructure statistics show the same slope of 0.85 and this systematic behavior appears to be the same across the globe. 

Another great example would be the down sides of metropolis: what accompanies all the convenience, higher innovation rate, and living standards is higher crime rate, pollution, and disease. To approximately the same degree, negative indicators of human social behaviors increase systematically with city size. A young man who expects to enjoy the high quality of life in Paris, while expecting unwillingly a higher rate of being picked pocket. The best thing of these scaling findings is that they apply to cities with different “taste and feels”. New York, Chicago, LA, all exhibit the same version of scaling. You can actually measure and predict the approximate average income in a considerable accuracy applying the scale method for cities in the same urban systems.

Geoff West acknowledged the potential of Big Data, but he claimed that “something” is missing with mere analysis provided by Big Data and that is all concepts, ideas, and characteristics of the complex adaptive systems (ecosystems, societies, etc). Big Data can indeed, as shown above by the scale implementations, provide a powerful tool for predicting and understanding the behavior of many systems, but we should recognize its simplicity resulted from limited calculations and equations. Therefore, Big Data cannot literally explain everything.

Although radical thinkers in Big Data’s supporters like our old friend Anderson purposed ideas that fully rejects the usefulness of traditional theories in the future, Geoff provided a fascinating example of the discovery of Higgs Particles that involves integration of Big Data and traditional theories. Based on our fundamental understandings in basic laws of physics and analysis of thousands of results from mathematical computations, a giant particle accelerator that can generate 600 million collisions per second, representing Big Data, discovers the Higgs mechanism. Needless to say, data itself doesn’t speak unless traditional theories merge in.
