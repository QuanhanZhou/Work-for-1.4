# DS Reflection 3
## Question1: How does Owen Barder define development? How does he extend Amartya Sen’s definition to include the idea of complexity?
Owen Barder defines development as a property of the system as a whole, which includes the emergence of self-organizing complexity. Amartya’s definition of development is more general: a gradual process that increases people’s choice capabilities and freedom. Barder adds the element of complexity by stating that development is made of adaptive people, industries, governments, and societies, such that it should behave as a complex adaptive system.   
## Question #2. What was the toaster project? What did Thomas Thwaites attempt to do? Was he successful? What is the significance of this example in the context of complexity?
The toaster project is a project that mimics how hard development from the beginning can be to find out why and how some countries experience a rapid rate of development while other countries don’t. Thomas Thwaites attempted to make a 6 US dollar toaster from scratch, meaning that he will build every single piece of a cheap toaster by himself. He was partially successful by making the toaster work for 5 seconds until it cracked down. This project is significant as it demonstrated how complex a development can be, even for a cheap toaster---we need a system of economics, financial, legal, political, and social institutions that combine firms, products, and technologies for development.   
## Question #3.  According to Barder how successful have economic models been at describing and predicting growth over the past 50 years?
First comes the Harrod-Domar growth model which states that with increasing labor and increasing capital, there should be increasing output as a result. However, the model is proven to be not consistent with reality. Owen Barder gave an example of a Nigeria steel factory that received over 5 billion dollars’ investment, but eventually no steel was produced due to bad management and corruption. Next, the Neoclassical growth theory added a third factor to the original model, which is called the exogenous technical change. Although the model is far more reliable, the third factor that comes out of nowhere is still a mystery. Being frustrated by the complexity of development, some scientists turned their views on government policies and declared the Washington Consensus that should have improved government policies, but failed eventually. Therefore, according to Barder, economic models attempted to describe and predict growth is not successful, at least relatively speaking.   
## Question #4.  Who was Steve Jones? What did he do at uni-lever? Was he successful? How significant were his results?
Steve Jones is a famous biologist who began his career in uni-lever as a designer for nozzle. He was asked to come up to a better nozzle to replace the original inefficient one. He did lots of experiments that let the computer generate each time 45 random designs of nozzles and tested them to select ten of them that worked the best. And he repeated the process lots of times until he came up with a weird-looking design that no human being could ever imagine. The design was so successful that it increased hundreds of times of proficiency.   
## Question #5.  What is a complex adaptive system? What are some of its important features?
A complex adaptive system is a system that include great number of interactions between a very large number of adaptive agents. Here are some of its important features. First, the system is difficult to predict in detail. For instance, you will not able to predict how a butterfly flapping its wings could affect the world. Second, you can make broad prediction such as the future direction of the system. Third, the complex adaptive system has emergent properties, like our conscious mind. Fourth, it tends towards greater complexity. And fifth, systems do not tend towards an equilibrium.  
## Question #6.  Who was Haile Sellasie?  According to Barder (and Kapuscinski), how did Ethiopia during the time of The Emperor exemplify the suppression of emergent systemic change?
Haile Sellasie was the last Emperor of Ethiopia that ended his domination in 1975. The Emperor had specific routines that expressed his control over the country every day and things like poverty and rebellion would never reach the ear of the Emperor. Anything that might improve development of a country will not be approved by the Emperor, thus exemplifying the suppression of emergent systemic change.  
## Question #7. Why does Barder recommend resisting engineering as a policy implication? What did he mean by iso-morphic mimicry?
He doesn’t mean that engineering is malicious, but the government should harness evolution and avoid isomorphic mimicry in the meantime of resisting engineering. Isomorphic mimicry is a phenomenon that describes a government’s establishment of novel industries with “beautiful outlook”, but lacking the kernel part of innovation and the ability to produce output (not functional organizations).   
## Question #8.  What does Barder mean by "resist fatalism"? Who was Norman Borlaug and what is the green revolution?
I think Barder was trying to employ the idea to developing countries with poor conditions that nature could be changed by human beings and development could be possible by wise government. Norman Borlaug brought the green revolution by intervening the evolution process to develop high-yield disease resistant wheat varieties. This was estimated to save billions of lives from starvation.
