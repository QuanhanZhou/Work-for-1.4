# DS Reflection 3
## Question1: How does Owen Barder define development? How does he extend Amartya Sen’s definition to include the idea of complexity?
Owen Barder defines development as a property of the system as a whole, which includes the emergence of self-organizing complexity. Amartya’s definition of development is more general: a gradual process that increases people’s choice capabilities and freedom. Barder adds the element of complexity by stating that development is made of adaptive people, industries, governments, and societies, such that it should behave as a complex adaptive system.   
## Question #2. What was the toaster project? What did Thomas Thwaites attempt to do? Was he successful? What is the significance of this example in the context of complexity?
The toaster project is a project that mimics how hard development from the beginning can be to find out why and how some countries experience a rapid rate of development while other countries don’t. Thomas Thwaites attempted to make a 6 US dollar toaster from scratch, meaning that he will build every single piece of a cheap toaster by himself. He was partially successful by making the toaster work for 5 seconds until it cracked down. This project is significant as it demonstrated how complex a development can be, even for a cheap toaster---we need a system of economics, financial, legal, political, and social institutions that combine firms, products, and technologies for development.   
## Question #3.  According to Barder how successful have economic models been at describing and predicting growth over the past 50 years?
First comes the Harrod-Domar growth model which states that with increasing labor and increasing capital, there should be increasing output as a result. However, the model is proven to be not consistent with reality. Owen Barder gave an example of a Nigeria steel factory that received over 5 billion dollars’ investment, but eventually no steel was produced due to bad management and corruption. Next, the Neoclassical growth theory added a third factor to the original model, which is called the exogenous technical change. Although the model is far more reliable, the third factor that comes out of nowhere is still a mystery. Being frustrated by the complexity of development, some scientists turned their views on government policies and declared the Washington Consensus that should have improved government policies, but failed eventually. Therefore, according to Barder, economic models attempted to describe and predict growth is not successful, at least relatively speaking.
